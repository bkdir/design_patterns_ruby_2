## Design Patterns in Ruby

Code examples are written in Ruby and taken mostly from Rem Zolotykh's Tuts+ course.  
Original files are also available in github. 
These files are written by me. I have added some additinional test cases and refactored a bit. 

12 Design Patterns implemented in this project:  

* Template Method

* Singleton
* Builder
* Composite
* Decorator
* Proxy
* Adapter
